# The Hackathon will focus on two key challenges:
- Predicting Team Winning Probability: Build a model to predict a teamâ€™s winning probability based on player performance statistics using the provided datasets (2019-2020 Fixtures and 2020-2021 Fixtures). (more details: Link)
- Identifying the Best Tactical Position: Develop an AI model to identify the best tactical position for a player based on their recent performance using the datasets (Premier League Players 23_24 Stats).

# Selection can be based on the following criteria:
- Accuracy of Models: Evaluate the predictive performance of their AI models using appropriate metrics (e.g., precision, recall).
- Innovation: Assess how innovative their approaches and methodologies are in tackling the challenges.
- Use of Data: Review how effectively they utilized and integrated the provided datasets.
- Scalability: Determine how well their solutions can be applied or adapted to broader contexts.
- Presentation and Clarity: Evaluate how clearly and professionally they present their solutions during the demo.
